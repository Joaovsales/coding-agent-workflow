## Downstream Delivery — worktree-bootstrap distribution — 2026-08-17 2820378

Spec: specs/worktree-bootstrap-distribution.md (AC8)
Commit: 282037822a7b946726d6506a097d43edbfce1ef0
PR: https://github.com/Joaovsales/coding-agent-workflow/pull/65

**AC8** — Downstream reachability of `bootstrap-worktree.sh` demonstrated, not asserted.

### (a) The script is an incoming file over `/sync`'s syncable path list

Diffed the branch against `origin/master` restricted to the declared syncable paths —
the same argument list `/sync` and the `session-start.sh` drift check use:

```
git diff --name-only origin/master fix/distribute-worktree-bootstrap -- \
  .agents/skills .agents/agents .claude/skills .claude/agents \
  .claude/hooks .claude/settings.json CLAUDE.md
```

11 files, including both copies of the script:

```
.agents/skills/build/scripts/bootstrap-worktree.sh
.claude/skills/build/scripts/bootstrap-worktree.sh
```

Before this change the script lived at `scripts/bootstrap-worktree.sh` and this same
command returned nothing for it — the file was invisible to `/sync` while four skills
instructed agents to run it. The remaining three files in the commit
(`specs/`, `tests/`, `project-template/.gitattributes`) correctly do **not** appear:
they are outside the syncable set by design.

### (b) `install.sh`'s `cp -r .agents/*` delivers it executable

Copied `.agents/*` into a scratch directory standing in for `~/.agents`:

```
-rwxr-xr-x  3728  fake-home-agents/skills/build/scripts/bootstrap-worktree.sh
```

Git index mode — the meaningful check on Windows, where the filesystem bit is not
authoritative — is `100755` on both trees, same blob:

```
100755 a3afbd4d118c08bd011b593d0f8ff87bbbc15f6e 0  .agents/skills/build/scripts/bootstrap-worktree.sh
100755 a3afbd4d118c08bd011b593d0f8ff87bbbc15f6e 0  .claude/skills/build/scripts/bootstrap-worktree.sh
```

### (c) It executes from the delivered location

Invoking the copy under the scratch `~/.agents` reached its `git worktree add` call and
was rejected by git on the argument, not by the shell on the file — proving the delivered
copy is runnable rather than merely present. `bash -n` reports clean syntax.

Result: PASS

### Environment note

`bash tests/run.sh` locally: 17/18 files pass. `tests/test-codex-install.sh` →
*"SessionStart output validates as Codex JSON"* fails on Windows only, and is
**pre-existing on master** — reproduced at `0064efe` in a clean detached worktree without
this commit. Cause: Python 3.13 on Windows defaults to cp1252, so `json.loads` raises
`UnicodeEncodeError` on the hook banner's non-ASCII characters before parsing. CI (Linux)
reports the full suite green for this commit.
