# /learn — Capture Session Learnings

Extract durable learnings from this session and persist each as a typed document
under `tasks/solutions/<category>/<slug>.md`, plus one narrative entry in
`tasks/history.md`. The schema, `problem_type` enum, and category map live in
`tasks/solutions/README.md` — documents must validate against it
(`tests/test-solutions-schema.sh` enforces this in the template repo).

## Steps

### 1. Review the Session
- Run `git log --oneline -10` to see what changed
- Read `tasks/todo.md` to see what was completed
- Recall any corrections the user made or surprises encountered

### 2. Extract 1–5 Learnings
Focus on insights that would prevent future mistakes or speed up future work:
- Mistakes made and their root causes → **bug track**
- Effective approaches discovered, architectural decisions, edge cases,
  workflow patterns → **knowledge track**

Skip trivial or one-off observations. Only persist learnings with reuse value.

### 3. Ground Every Claim
A claim about how code behaves must be **verified against the tree and cited as
`file:line`**, or softened and attributed ("this session observed…"). Cite PR
numbers, not bare commit SHAs — rebase and squash merges rewrite SHAs. A learning
with no verifiable code claim goes on the knowledge track with its claims
attributed to the session rather than stated as fact.

### 4. Score Overlap Before Writing
For each candidate, compare against existing documents (grep
`tasks/solutions/` frontmatter: `problem_type`, `module`, `tags`) across five
dimensions: **problem, root cause, solution, files touched, prevention rule**.

| Score | Dimensions matched | Action |
|-------|--------------------|--------|
| High | 4–5 | Update the existing document. Do not create a second one. |
| Moderate | 2–3 | Create the new document and cross-link both. |
| Low | 0–1 | Create the new document. |

If the existing document is wrong, update it and note the correction — never add
a contradicting sibling.

### 5. Write the Documents
Create `tasks/solutions/` (and the category directory) if absent — first write
bootstraps the store. Filename is a stable ASCII kebab-case slug from the title;
**the date goes in frontmatter, never in the filename**. Frontmatter per track:

- both tracks: `title`, `date`, `problem_type`, `module`, `tags`
- bug track: `symptoms`, `root_cause`, `resolution`
- knowledge track: `applies_when`

A document with an inferred or missing required field gets `needs_review: true`
so `/memory-maintain` sweeps it later.

### 6. Append the Session Entry to `tasks/history.md`
The narrative log records what happened, not learnings:

```
### [YYYY-MM-DD] — [2-3 word summary]
- Key changes: [bullet list of what was built/changed]
- Learnings captured: [links to the tasks/solutions/ documents, or "none"]
```

### 7. Confirm
Reply: "Learnings captured: [N] documents in `tasks/solutions/` ([updated/created]), history entry appended."

## Optional: `--cleanup`

When invoked as `/learn --cleanup`, after completing Steps 1–7, run a folder sweep to surface legacy or unused files for archival.

For each directory that has accumulated session artifacts:
1. List all files and check creation dates via `git log --follow --oneline -- <file>`
2. Flag files that:
   - Were created more than 30 days ago and have never been read in recent sessions
   - Are referenced by no current spec, task, or source file
   - Appear to be one-off experiments (scratch files, test outputs, temporary logs)
3. Propose archival:
   > "These files appear unused: [list]. Archive to `archive/` or delete? (archive/delete/keep each)"
4. Act on user response. Do not delete without confirmation.

Skip: `tasks/`, `specs/`, `.claude/`, `.agents/` — these are always kept.
